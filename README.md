# Dynamic programming
For each problem, I provide three methods for solving it.<br />
1.recursive-->brute force<br />
2.dynamic programming-->memorization<br />
3.dynamic programming-->tabulation<br />

## Problem1
The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..<br />

## Problem2
The problem is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move only to right or down.<br />

## Problem3
Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.<br />

## Problem4
Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, find a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.<br />

## Problem5
Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, find a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum with the shortest path.<br />

## Problem6
Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out if the input string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.<br />

## Problem7
Given an input string and a dictionary of words, count all the cases in which the input string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.<br />

## Problem8
Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out all the cases in which the input string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.<br />
